# ThinkCPP

Originally based on Text and code for Think C++ by Allen Downey

This project is taking the great book by Allen Downey and adding more modern C++ to the explanations and examples. In addition, most of the examples will be changing to be more based on games.

(It looks like I am going to be doing so many changes that I am moving it over to a non-forked project at lpatacch\thinkCPPGames. It is still public and available. I just wanted to prevent it from being accidentally merged with the original project. ThinkCPP project will contain any sections that I think that could be useful to someone other that me. The other project will also have formatting changes, so many parts will not be usable to other thinkCPP creators until the formating is changed back.)
